<div class="paragraph">
<p>Twenty minutes. It had been twenty minutes since Asako Reina handed Isawa Hifumi the documents. Yet, still, Hifumi watched her, studying her, analyzing every word, every gesture. She had tried explaining, then pleading, shouting, then retreating into bitter surliness. Now she stood silent, twitching, trying to read the expression in Hifumi&#8217;s eyes, the way he held the documents in his hands. Documents that all centered around a single point, a single objective&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;how to save the Empire-In-Waiting. Permanently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reina felt the problems of the Empire-in-Waiting crawling across her skin like tainted insects. There was no doubt that this tiny Empire would crumble. Everything fails to live up to its potential, due to that hated disease ‚Äì "human nature". And this Empire-In-Waiting was collapsing faster than expected. The Empress supported the Mantis pirates. Her champions turn a blind eye to the secret conspiracy she&#8217;d detected called The Pact. The Crane ignored&#8230;&#8203;no, defeated, the inquisitors sent to prevent vile elements from spreading within them. The Imperials failed as arbitrators. A single shove, and the clans would declare independence and abandon the traditional courts. And once that happened, Reina had no doubt the beliefs of the ancestors would be tossed aside, replaced with new beliefs. Disturbing beliefs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Beliefs&#8230;&#8203;like the beliefs you now hold. You hate who you are, and what you will become. You want to save yourself&#8230;&#8203;to stop yourself from falling further. Even if that means sacrificing everyone else.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Control. We <strong>must</strong> have control. We must if we are to save the Empire. Shiba Yohana offered another approach. Kill the gods and acquire new ones? Undead inquisitors, villains who will enforce orthodoxy at swordpoint? Immoral! My approach&#8230;&#8203;.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>&#8230;&#8203;is also immoral, but at least your sensei would approve.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hifumi set the documents aside. "You went missing for three days." His voice held no trace of emotion. His eyes were cold.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I know." Reina gazed at the floor, as if she was staring deep into Jigkou itself. "It was necessary."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Still no emotion. "I sent you to spy on The Pact, to discover if they have been ensnared in the mechanisms of the Lying Darkness. I sent you study claims that they have among them ones who are Void-touched. Find their secrets."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I did all that."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"While you were gone, the Empty City was attacked by traitors aligned with Asako Kousuke and Shiba Kei. We rooted them out, of course."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reina twitched again, but said nothing. <em>If Hifumi truly thought I had betrayed him, then I wouldn&#8217;t be standing here today. But I should have been here.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>You were not here. You ran. The rebels are looking for <strong>you</strong>. They want to *stop *you ‚Äì they attack out of desperation. They know you are right.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hifumi laid a hand on the pile of documents and charts Reina had presented.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"This document. This thing you describe. This ‚ÄòRift to T≈çshigoku?' Tell me of it." Hifumi flicked his fingers again through the pages, but it was clear he did not need to read it again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I needed the knowledge. And I now have it." Reina laughed. "And now&#8230;&#8203;now you have it too."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A flicker of distaste flickered across Hifumi&#8217;s cool features. "I sent Shiba Akane after you, you know. She was about to give up, but then a pillar of flames appeared from the ground. Unnatural flames. And then you ran out of these flames, screaming maniacally."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reina said nothing, feeling the crawling insects again infect the room with their indolent somnolence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"It took hours to calm you down and verify that you were not some spirit wearing your form. When you finally recovered, you wrote&#8230;&#8203;this." He tapped the stack of documents again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The documents explain everything."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Perhaps." The Phoenix leader&#8217;s voice was cold. "Tell me of Kaito Urabe."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Urabe. I remember Kaito Urabe. He was the one who showed me the *path*</em>.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kaito Urabe was a wide-eyed, innocent, and naive youth. He had a round face and chipmunk cheeks. Long bangs framed his wide black eyes, the black hair tied into a black foxtail at his nape. Cheerful, brave, generous&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all the gifts of a talented samurai, save for a single phobia&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the sky. He felt a sense of spiritual unease looking at the sky, fearful of what secrets lurk there. Reina had dismissed it as baseless paranoia, perhaps a side effect of too much time indoors as a child.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Urabe painted landscapes&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;landscapes that no one had ever seen. Strange areas&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a cavern of stolen hopes, a temple of lost deeds, a mysterious path of reflection. Urabe would never finish a single painting. He enjoyed creativity, never the finished product. But those half-complete paintings, Reina had found, reveal unknown lands, later discovered. Predict events, later revealed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reina suspected, on discovering Urabe&#8217;s talent, that Urabe was himself a Void acolyte. Too weak to truly be considered Ishiken, but here, where the veil between the Celestial Realms was so thin, the void itself inspired him. What to paint, when to paint, how to paint, why to paint. Whatever the void told him, Urabe obeyed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Your order monitored Kaito Urabe constantly&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;they wanted to "learn" from him. The Order had knowledge, but only because they stole it from others.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Order. It had been so long since she acknowledged others, besides the Path of Man. Beside The Henshin Order&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ishiken, even mere acolytes, generally came from the Isawa family. Outsiders were treated with suspicion. Kaito Urabe, resenting this discrimination, avoided the Isawa, and eventually contacted Shiba Ryuu, who took an interest in Kaito Urabe&#8217;s artistic talents. Urabe would regularly sell his half-completed paintings to Ryuu.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ryuu was part of The Pact, a group of famous explorers, Reina believed, had been touched by the Void, using Urabe&#8217;s paintings to locate interesting territories in Sanctuary. Their explorers would develop high-quality maps to sell to the Miya cartographers. And from there, the images were passed on to fallen, weak, selfish, corruptible people.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Pact. Did they really even need Urabe&#8217;s paintings? Or did the darkness without a face tell them where to go, what secrets to show? Reina had never learned. Yet the paintings were still important ‚Äì for they were part of a causal chain of events. She did not know if The Pact wished the expansion across Sanctuary to bring those lands into existence, to bring people into the clutches of the darkness more easily.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>If the void allows us to conquer everything with a snap of our fingers, then there would be no more rules in the Realm of Mortals. Reality itself would shatter. Urabe plays a role. An important role. A beautiful role.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But then came the day when Urabe broke free, and drew a horrible landscape, an all-consuming revelation that scarred his mind and left him dazed for days. The void-touched artisan could not bear to burn his masterpiece. Urabe had fled, trying to find the perfect place to bury his art underground, where no one could find it. That was where Reina had found him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Concealed knowledge might as well not exist.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was the plains of last judgment, a forlorn area associated with death and destruction. He thought nobody would dare go there. He was wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>But I waited for him. I am not afraid of death, only ignorance.</em></p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Urabe drew his blade, his hands shaking. Reina did not know whether he was trying to threaten her, himself, or the precious artwork. "This painting will cause a catastrophe."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"As opposed to the catastrophe that we already face? You&#8217;ll let that be?" Reina drew her own katana, but did not move towards him. She did not dare.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Urabe did not move. "The lesser of two evils is still evil. Let me avert this current catastrophe, and the future shall handle its own affairs."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"To keep your hands clean, you&#8217;ll let the future fall?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reina could be persuasive when she needed to be. She spoke of duty, but it was not enough. She spoke of glory, and almost reached him. "You have talents, Urabe-san. You can do things that even the spirits can only dream of. But only, and <strong>only</strong>, if you used those talents."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"You&#8217;re talking about ishiken, and we left them all on the mainland. I&#8217;m just a mere acolyte&#8230;&#8203;a lowly painter for The Pact."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"And you can be more than that."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Let Urabe fill in the blanks with his hopes and dreams. You learnt well from your sensei.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Her conscience reproached her; she pushed it down with practiced ease.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I don&#8217;t want to be." Urabe&#8217;s hands trembled. "I&#8217;ve left so many paintings behind. They are more than enough to speak to me. But I can not let this happen. No one can see this painting. Ever." He lashed out at her then, a clumsy blow that he had put his entire weight into. She sidestepped easily.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Truly, you could have been great."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Urabe succumbed to the praise before he succumbed to Reina&#8217;s katana. There was no snow on the plains, and yet the air was cold.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>‚Äî</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later, much later, Reina unfurled Urabe&#8217;s dreaded painting. It consisted of a series of tall mountains, towering over the rest of Sanctuary. Urabe named the tallest mountain "Eagle&#8217;s Rest Peak".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Whoever climbs it will see everything.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reina carried a spyglass with her and used it often, searching for the horror that Urabe hinted at. But, she found none. At the top of Eagle&#8217;s Rest Peak, she used her spyglass: from there, one could see the whole world. She could see the border skirmishes of the Crab and Unicorn, the trade deals being made in Yatakabune Port, the creation of orange dye by Phoenix peasants. She felt could see anything on the ground. Every virtue, every vice. Everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, Reina turned her spyglass to the sky, and felt that, for that moment, she was falling into infinity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There seemed no veil between the realms, each reeling one into the other like the fold of a fan. Panic enveloped her as the sky changed colors. One moment, it became calm and tranquil, just like Meido. A second moment, orderly and structured, like Tengoku. A third moment, confusing and bizarre, like Yume-d≈ç. Turning away, she looked down to see Sanctuary enveloped by these overlapping realms, shifting, changing, morphing ‚Äì even though it was always this way, and would always be this way. Reality shifting and changing in ways Reina had never imagined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking back at the sky, the Asako saw a flow tinged with red. She smelled ash and blood, while hot winds brushed her face.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>T≈çshigoku, the Realm of Slaughter.</em> Of course it was revealed here, to only her. Asako Reina. She wondered how many times has this "realm" brushed up against mortals, how much influence it had on Sanctuary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>We were so close to its violence, so close to its hatred and endless battle, and yet we did not know, too busy enjoying "reality" to realize its multifaceted nature.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>T≈çshigoku beckoned. The mountains around her dissolved into chaotic violence that she refused to understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reina dropped the spyglass and lost consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>‚Äî</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With new eyes, Asako Reina awakened in a brightly-lit corridor. The floor was littered with the rotten skeletons of the human defenders of Sanctuary, still wearing the armor of the Empire of the Five Rivers, the armor the robes kept forever polished in the Empty City. Perhaps, once, these were scouts who made it to Eagle&#8217;s Rest Peak, who had seen what she had seen. Or maybe they were the spirits of T≈çshigoku itself, who had murdered each other just a few hours before.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Either way, Reina paid her respects to the dead before walking past their dry bones and towards what at least seemed a light.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As she walked, she noticed beautiful paintings on the walls. Paintings of herself, eating some good food. an Empty City Archivist looking through some books. A samurai from the Dragon, Mirumoto Rei, training a group of students. The Empress at the bow of her flagship, approaching the hidden island. A man&#8217;s blood dripping into a bubbling hot spring. Reina could not help but stop to admire, to stumble upon the last, herself, in this exact corridor, looking at these exact paintings. She saw everything, but could not understand. In that moment, she did not care.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>There are no secrets here, no lies or deception. This corridor is an art gallery, carefully curated by wise deities. Each painting, a theme, an idea, a belief. The art gallery is merely context, to justify the paintings' existence. But each painting&#8230;&#8203;so wonderful!</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reina reached out a hand to touch one of the paintings, but flinched. It burned! Then, she had to look even more closely. The paintings appeared so old and ancient, yet they portrayed events that happened just recently in Sanctuary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reina&#8217;s heart started to beat faster. She began running towards the light, ignoring the paintings on the walls.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>I cannot retreat from revelation, I cannot retreat from truth, I must face it head-on, even if it will kill me.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ahead, she was confronted with burning flames, reaching to the top of the corridor&#8217;s ceiling. The flames shifted between purple and red. Reina lifted an arm to shield her eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The flames spoke. "We always expected you. We will always expect you."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Who are you?" Reina shouted, turning her face away.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"A wound. The boundary rips. A wound that cuts deep into Sanctuary itself. A wound <span class="underline">you</span> have opened."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Darkness, despair, resentment. These burn the souls of men in fires that will not die. Here they burn still."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"T≈çshigoku, the Realm of Slaughter."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The flames did not answer to affirm her conclusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reina slowly lowered her arm, her eyes burning. "And you&#8217;re influencing Sanctuary. The endless war in the Empty City, first between the Robes and Yoite, and now between Hifumi and the rebels. The clans fighting each other&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Unicorn and Crab. Scorpion and Lion. It&#8217;s all because of you, isn&#8217;t it? Driving us ever more to our doom?" She wanted to weep.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The flames did not respond.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Are there more of these wounds? More of these gates? Not just to T≈çshigoku, but to the other Spirit Realms?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The flames laughed. "The veil is thin, easily broken. You disturb what has been at rest for a thousand years."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This would explain the many supernatural oddities in Sanctuary. "How do I repair the veil? Heal these wounds?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"You cannot eliminate these wounds. To wound, to destroy. That is what you are."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"How do I mitigate these wounds then? The wounds here, they seem more severe, more&#8230;&#8203;destructive."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"You will not. You have come to us, with your blood and your hate. We see. We know the footsteps you have taken to reach this place. And we can follow your footsteps back."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some last black well of horror emerged in her spirit before Reina made her final realization. "I could let you destroy me. Destroy myself. You could not follow me then."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"It is not enough. Centuries of war, the forgotten battles of spirits who no longer remember the purpose of creation. Someday, somewhere, another will die. Then another. It is only a matter of time. We will find a way." The flames almost gloated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We could destroy the Empty City and the fighting between the spirits."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Perhaps."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Not enough? Must we destroy all fighting, all bloodshed? Everywhere?"
Suddenly the idea was so beautiful, so perfect in Reina&#8217;s mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>A thousand years, frozen like a spider in perfect amber, waiting for the beautiful day when the reign of the Dark Brother has past and the descendent of Shinsei arises to call all of us, all of our strength, and power, to stand the forces of Jigoku on that day, the Third Day of Thunder. The last day of Thunder. We could be heroes. We would <span class="underline">all</span> be heroes. And, until then, perfect&#8230;&#8203;.crystalline&#8230;&#8203;stillness. Waiting for the moment to arise.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>No risk to the veil between the worlds. No bloodshed. No heresy. No decay. No death. Frozen, until a new age would come again.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She wanted to laugh. She wanted to weep.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>If Urabe were here, he would urge me to wage a war against these wounds. Deal with the situation you are in now. If necessary, destroy the Empty City, seal this breach. Yet, I cannot do that. The Empty City is the source of our power, our strength. Such a spiritual battle would cause the Empty City, at least, and all its troubled spirits, to crumble into dust and leave us with no political base. I will not let that happen.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sanctuary is known for its oddities. The names of the Fortunes. The Scorpions' war against the moving golems. The fertility of the Lion lands. The Crane&#8217;s war against nature spirits. The Dragons' relations with the ningyo. The deities that inhabit the Unicorns' endless caves. All strange things&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;were they all wounds caused by their own arrival? Should she&#8230;&#8203;.could she&#8230;&#8203; let these wounds fester? Or administer a deadly cure?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>No, neither! There must be a third path. A path that allows us to retain the supernatural, while still breaking the cycle of the Empty City.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The flames flickered. "You must act. The world burns around you."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Was that me, or the fire?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The flames vomited out a black book. Reina grabbed it with both her hands. On it was one word&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;_Onyx. _She hesitantly opened the book, and started reading, not feeling the sweat that poured down her forehead, the fires that flickered around her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Onyx</em> seemed merely a beautiful artbook with printed words, beginning with timeless paintings of the very creation of <em>a</em> Celestial Order, then the origin of all the things of the Empire. Humans and spirits, the divine and the mundane. Everything. They were beautiful, with no past and no future&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;just an endless present.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Is this real? Illusion? Is there a difference?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These paintings. This was the reality of the world. Everything else was merely scenery in an elaborate art gallery. Humans? An audience that the paintings are poured out for, in a world that mutilates itself in its performance, over and over again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There, the Empire burns with the forces of Jigoku, a scene applauded by the Elemental Dragons. But then, burned to ashes, and then revived. Empires built anew, ever changing, ever open to wounds, to defeat. An Onyx Empire in the ashes of Otosan Uchi. Another generation of grist for T≈çshigoku&#8217;s mill.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Her own empire, damned from its moment of creation. Humans, a mere byproduct of reality, transient things to be used, abused, and tossed aside. Human nature is real. Humans are not.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reina did not want to know more. <em>How many Celestial Orders are there?</em> Her loyalty lay to her own order, even if it, too, was no more than an illusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"How many worlds are there?" The Asako yelled to the flames. The flames laughed, but they laughed in Reina&#8217;s own voice. She already knew the answer. Go to the ocean. Count the drops of water. For each drop of water, that&#8217;s one Celestial Order.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The illusions stripped away. Reina had thought she would scream. Instead, she smiled. The solution seemed so clear. If art is the reality, then make art.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Freeze the pictures. End the story. Right here. That which does not change cannot decay.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>But how?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>The world is mutable. Those who are extremely skilled with the Void&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the ishiken&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;can shape the world, just like the paintings of Onyx. And if they shape the world properly, then humans can become more than mere scenery. Humans could then transcend their human nature, and turn into deities, eternal and unchanging. No past regrets. No future to be afraid of. Only an eternal present. Frozen into art.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>By turning everyone into divine paintings, by freezing Sanctuary outright, we solve all our problems. We would break the cycle of violence without endangering the Empty City, because everything would be frozen in place&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and the spirits cannot fight if they are frozen in place. Sanctuary would no longer have to worry about internal turmoil, supernatural incursions, and heretical plots&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;because all these situations require change, and change does not exist in a frozen state of affairs. No more border skirmishes. No more injustices. The ends will finally justify the means.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All she needed was an Ishiken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>I can save countless lives. Even my own.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>‚Äî-</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When she was finished, Reina threw <em>Onyx</em> back into the flames. It was eagerly consumed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Turn around."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the walls, Reina saw a new painting that looked like something immortal. A divine being. Like herself, but not&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;only someone that looked just like her. In her hand, she held a candle. It was made of ice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The voice, the flames perhaps, but different, answered a final time. "The story may shift. The ending is the same. There is no forgiveness. We have always existed. We will always exist. We are the reality of the blood on your blade. The hatred in your hearts. You may try to stop it if you wish. You will fail."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A thousand visions of blood and death poured out on an endless sea of violence spilled out before Reina as the paintings dissolved and panic poured itself into her soul. They were still there, behind her eyes, but she could not see.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She awoke in darkness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And too much light.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>‚Äî-</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Isawa Hifumi frowned, flipping one page of the book of scattered pages in front of him. "You painted this?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reina nodded warily. <em>We must freeze it all. We must make it perfect. Perhaps he will listen. Even if he opposes me, he <span class="underline">must</span> listen.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Isawa continued. "We have reports from Lion lands of a group of invaders on a boat, dark cloaked figures who look just like the ones you painted. The Lion killed them all."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"More violence! It will bring the Realm of Slaughter closer."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hifumo ignored her, flipping the page to the next picture. "Your pictures. Some depict things that you could not have known, but are true anyway. Can you account for this?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The pictures don&#8217;t matter. They only show more violence." Desperation rung in her words. "You <span class="underline">know</span> I am telling the truth! We can save the Empire! Freeze Sanctuary&#8230;&#8203;Now, at this moment. Bring an end to it until we are needed."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"You are insane." There was no judgement in Hifumi&#8217;s tone. A mild, clinical sadness. "Your plan would perhaps save the Empire. But only by hollowing it out." Hifumi steepled his fingers as he played with thoughts. "How do we save the Empire from its inevitable fall? How do we stop the intrusion of T≈çshigoku on Ningen-do, if all that is required is any act of violence? Is an act required? Or are thoughts enough? If one were to erase human intellect, revert back to animalistic urges, would that stop the corruption? Would that be enough? Or if we were to turn into plants, liberated from free will? Or maybe&#8230;&#8203;is fear and what your fancy is of Shiba Yohana&#8217;s path of action and heresy sufficient?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reina fell to her knees before Hifumi. "You understand, then, don&#8217;t you? Why we must do this? To save the Empire! We will be heroes! WE will be the Thunders!"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>H</em><em>umans <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> want to be heroes. Heroes suffer and scream. All so that future generations can exploit and misuse their legacy. People want to enjoy life&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;not protect it.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Every plan has trade-offs, trade-offs that are disgusting and disturbing. He understands your plan. But he rejects it.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Just like you.</em></p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Isawa Hifumi looked down at the kneeling, sobbing woman, crawling across the floor towards him. Pity welled up in his heart, a place where he had thought pity had faded to logic long ago. Asako Reina had been a friend, once. A trusted ally. Alas, she had become too obsessed with the Void, the secrets of this city. Now she returned, robes still bloody from killing that poor artisan, Kaito Urabe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And maybe she had done worse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"You are mad." He made a gesture towards the silently watching Shiba Akane, who summoned three guards from the hallway. "Do not fear. You will be spared for your crimes, in order to be studied. But you will not be allowed to go free."</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The guards caught Asako Reina up by the elbows before dragging her from the room. She did not resist. But she screamed and sobbed as they pulled her away, pleading for Hifumi to listen.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He sighed deeply.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was truth in Reina&#8217;s words. The veil was thin here. It could have been torn. There was enough bloodshed, even before Urabe&#8217;s death, to have wrenched it free.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There had to be another way to prevent the veil from tearing further. To save the Empire-to-be from the Realm of Slaughter. Something more sensible than Reina&#8217;s madness. But it would not be found like this. In the meantime, the Empress must be warned. And whatever it was that Reina saw from Eagle&#8217;s Rest Peak must be found. And controlled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The screams were fading. Hifumi felt a pang of sadness in his heart. Reina had been a friend. Maybe, she still was. Hifumi knew the madness of Reina well&#8230;&#8203;seeing that which was too terrible to accept. But wisdom required understanding that which could not be understood. Reina had danced the edge of Eagle&#8217;s Rest Peak, and fallen from that height.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hifumi sighed again. "There is no difference between salvation and annihilation. We can taste victory&#8230;&#8203;and victory tastes bitter."</p>
