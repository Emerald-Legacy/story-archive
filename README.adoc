toc::[]

== How to contribute or participate
If you find a typo, bad formatting, or anything else you think we should improve, please create an issue or a pull-request!

== How to translate a story
Choose a story in our Google Drive, copy the text to a new asciidoc file, and apply asciidoc formatting. You can check the existing stories as orientation for text formatting, title/background formatting, and image inclusion.

If you need access to the story directory in the Google Drive, ask programming-wolf. 

> **Important:** Create a new branch for every single story. Name it like the story, including the number. +
> Example: 03-bitter-destiny +
> We use Pull Requests to merge stories into the `main` branch.

=== Formatting Asciidoc
It's not sufficient to just copy the text from the PDFs into the asciidoc files. We need to manually adjust stuff like bold style, italic style, and horizontal lines, for example. Here are the most common code formatting things:

- Replace special single and double quotes with `'` and `"` respectively. They will be rendered properly by asciidoc. 
- Remove everything that's not part of the story, like "Emerald Legacy 2021" from the footer, for example.
- Merge lines that have been separated by page breaks.
- If there is a paragraph break in the pdf, you can create one in asciidoc by simply leaving a blank line between two lines of text. 
- If there is a single line break in the pdf, you can create one in asciidoc by adding
```
 +
```
to the end of the line (the whitespace in front of the `+` is important).

- You can format _italic text_ like this:
```
_italic text_
```
- You can format **bold text** like this:
```
**bold text**
```
- You can format **_emphasized text_** like this:
```
**_emphasized text_**
```
- You can create a horizontal rule with this:
```
'''
```
- You can enforce a page break with this:
```
<<<
```
- You can add more space between text and an image with this:
```
some text.

{empty} +

image::some_image.jpg
```
- You can include an image like as follows. The numbers are width and height, respectively:
```
image::image_in_images_dir.jpg[alt text, 200, 200]
```

Render the document from time to time to see if you like the changes you made. 

== How to build the documents

Prerequisites:
- Ruby 3.0 or higher
- Bundler gem (`gem install bundler`)

You build the output documents with Rake. That will produce both PDF and HTML files.

First, install the dependencies:

`bundle install`

Then build all stories:

`bundle exec rake build`

Or clean and rebuild:

`bundle exec rake clean build`

Available Rake tasks:
- `rake build` - Build all story files (index, stories, and chapter parts)
- `rake render_stories` - Render all story files to PDF and HTML
- `rake render_chapter_parts` - Render all chapter part files to PDF and HTML
- `rake render_index` - Render the index file to PDF and HTML
- `rake clean` - Remove generated HTML and PDF files
- `rake clobber` - Remove the entire build directory

== Maintainers

This repository is currently maintained by Ben Wolf (Hida Amoro, programming-wolf).
It was forked from https://github.com/isaqb-org/advanced-template,
so the contributors of that project basically contributed to this one, too.
